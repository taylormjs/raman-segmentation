## Nuclei Segmentation using Spatial Raman Spectroscopy

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tsorenso/raman-segmentation/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Project Overview

For this project, I will investigate the use of spatial Raman spectroscopy in segmenting images of nuclei.  Raman spectroscopy is a technique that has previously been used in identifying chemical compounds and is now being explored in molecular biology as a way of classifying cells by their cell-type or cell-state. Because Raman spectra taken at a single-cell level have been useful for identifying cell-type, it's natural to assume they may also be used to segment an image, differentiating the foreground from the background. Being able to segment cells with spatial Raman spectra -- as opposed to traditional RBG images -- would be monumental to the field of computer vision.


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tsorenso/raman-segmentation/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
