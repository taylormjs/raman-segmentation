## Nuclei Segmentation using Spatial Raman Spectroscopy


### Project Overview

For this project, I will investigate the use of spatial Raman spectroscopy in segmenting images of nuclei.  Raman spectroscopy is a technique that has previously been used in identifying chemical compounds and is now being explored in molecular biology as a way of classifying cells by their cell-type or cell-state. Because Raman spectra taken at a single-cell level have been useful for identifying cell-type, it's natural to assume they may also be used to segment an image, differentiating the foreground from the background. Being able to segment cells with spatial Raman spectra -- as opposed to traditional RBG images -- would be monumental to the field of computer vision.
