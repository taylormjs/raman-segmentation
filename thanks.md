I'm very grateful for Professor Gilbert Strang for teaching this course and for being so kind as we've had to adjust to different style of learning during the pandemic. This course was extremely useful for my understanding of Linear Algebra and Machine Learning. I'll continue to come back to this course again and again throughout my education and career. 

I'd also like to extend a lot of gratitude to my collaborators at the Broad Institute and MIT that have made this project possible. Koseki J. Kobayashi-Kirschvink generated all of the Raman tensors and nuclei images over the course of several busy weeks before the pandemic limited lab access. He also generated the background labels for this dataset.  Shreya Gaddam segmented most of the images using NucleAizer and applied a great deal of quality control, allowing for foreground labels. Csaba Molnar was one of the primary authors and creators of NucleAIzer and recommended it to my team as a state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation method.  Lastly, I'd like to thank my supervisors Tommaso Biancalani and Aviv Regev for their supervision and helping me improve my skills in Machine Learning and Data Science.
